# Hypothesis & Theory

- Science
  - Is not the prediction of something that is happening repeatedly.
  - Is the prediction of something that has not happened yet. These are called theories.
    Theory is the highest understanding we have of anything in the world.
    - Gives us an idea of what has happened.
    - Explains us what is happening. 
    - Give us the power of predicting what will happen in the future.
  - Something that is untested and it may or may not be true. It is called hypothesis.
- Not following Newton's Laws
  - Uranus was not following the laws. 
    Lead to discovery of Neptune.
  - Mercury was not following the laws.
    Newton's Law are not that precise when gravity is high. Requires Einstein laws of gravity to support the mercury's movement.
    - Einstein was not trying to explain Mercury's movement but see how theories should be true universally.
  - Neptune was not following the laws.
    - Pluto was first considered as the cause but it wasn't big enough. It was actually dis-labeled as planet later.
    - One of the observatories used to get the data was not precise and correct. They took out the data of that observatory out and Neptune started to move exactly according to the Newton's Laws.

# Biases

- Coin Flipping - Cosmic Perspective
  - Take 1000 people and give a coin to everyone.
    Ones who get tails sit down. Others continue.
  - At the end, we will have one person who got the heads all the time. 
  - Now the question is if that person is a special person?
    The bias is that we think that person is special and he won. But the nature of this experiment is a fact that someone will flip the coin and get heads all the time.
- Finding patterns that don't really exist - Cognitive Failures
  - People see face of Jesus on things (especially Christians). Not Muslims because they don't have a representation of Prophet Muhammad. This is a bias.
  - The pictures of Mars showed a rock that has a structure like human face when seen in a particular sunlight.
    The aliens could have made monuments with the face of dog or lobster. Why just a human face? That is a bias.
- Cold Statistics
  - We believe person testimony over the research or data.
  - We do the research about a particular car and decide to buy based on the fact that it is the safest car and most reliable one. But we go the car showroom and see one guy coming out of the there saying that this car is the worst car he has ever driven. We will have the effect of that person's statements on our decision more than the data and research that we saw before going there.
- Grand Misconception
  - Most dangerous is the confirmation bias.
  - You can find all the information you want, to show that you are correct. Even if you have to ignore a bigger chunk of information that doesn't align with your thoughts.
  - Search engines are a epitome of confirmation bias.
  - Horoscope Activity
    - Get a popular horoscope. Choose one horoscope and ask a group of people.
      - Do you think this is your horoscope? Raise you hand.
      - Do you think this is not your horoscope? Raise your hand.
    - Conclusion: A well written horoscope will fit you, doesn't matter what is happening in your life. This is how we select the things that align to our interest.
- Meteor Shower - Personal Truths
  - There are meteors that go across the earth's orbit. They leave some debris as they get closer to the sun and the ice sublimes to gas leaving a line of debris.
  - When the earth crosses that line of debris, the debris comes into earth's atmosphere and we call it meteor shower. 
  - This is why it happens at the same time of the year.
  - Bible mentions that the end of days (apocalypse) will comes when rocks fall from sky and land on sky. A person knowing Bible may believe that meteor shower or storm is the apocalypse. But in reality its just a meteor shower or storm. This is how our personal truths may conflict with the objective truths.
- Political Truths
  - If something is told to us again and again, we start to believe that is true.
- Precision and Accuracy
  - Back in the day, definition of seconds was year 1900 divided by number of seconds in the year. 
    The definition of second was dependent on the earth's rotation.
  - But then better ways of measuring second were used. (Seismometer)
  - They found that the earth rotation is slowing down. This showed how the definition of a measurement should be redefined every now and then to check if the current way of measurement is good enough.
  - Since 1972, twenty seven leap seconds have been added at the end of the year because the earth rotation was slowing down and the year is getting longer.
  - Precision: Closeness of different measurements to each other.
    A weighing scale gives three values of the same and the values are close to each other but may not be close to the expected value.
    Example: A 20 pound object is measured as 21.1, 21.1, 21.2. This is precise.
  - Accuracy: Closeness of given measurement to a certain value. 
    A weighing scale gives three values of the same object and the values are close to expected value.
    Example: A 20 pound object is measured as 19.9, 20.2, 20.3. This is accurate.

# Communication

- If you can add humor to a talk or teaching session, you are more able to grab their attention.
  - If you talk to a kid, talk about the kid movies. Use the vocabulary kids can understand.
  - If you talk to the senior, talk about the things they have lived through. Sputnik Launch and Crazy Americans.
- Use your hands, mouth, eyes, legs... to communicate your idea or sentence. It will double the effectiveness.
- Don't share all the details at once.
  - Start from the simplest explanation. Earth is sphere.
  - Add layers of information. When earth was forming, it was molten and tends to be squishy. That's why it is kind of flattened at poles and wider at equator. So earth is oblate spheroid.
  - More layers. It is wider below the equator than it is at equator. Earth is a pear shaped oblate spheroid.
